# Info
This game is basic Text Adventure, which means it works on a console with no graphics involved. In this game, you have to use a series of commands to have the character perform actions in order to move forward in the game.
# 
You can find the code for this game here: https://github.com/isaacfdez/Zork

# Guide
NOTE: If at any point don't know which command to use, you can always type help to show a list of available commands.
#
1. You start the game in the dungeon. If you inspect the dead guard, you will see it has the key of the dungeon. Loot the corpse, equip the items that you can, and go outside.
#
2. In the clearing, if you go east, you will find a section of the forest containing a helm and a chest with the key to the armory. Take both and equip the helm. Go south.
#
3. You will be at a new part of the forest, where lives a wild boar that will attack you when you trespass into it's territory. You should defeat the boar even if you didn't equip anything, but the boar will take a toll on your lifepoints if you didn't. Once you defeat the boar, go east.
#
4. This is the final part of the forest. At north there are the gates of freedom, but they are guarded by an ogre who has the key. If you inspect the ogre, you will see that he has better gear than you. You should go east first, and loot the armory for a better chance at defeating the ogre.
#
5. Once in the wall section, unlock the trap door to the armory with its key. Once in the armory, loot and equip everything you collect and go back to defeat the ogre.
#
6. After killing the ogre, you can loot his corpse to find the key of the gates, and reach the end of the game.

# Additional Comments
This has been the first time I've coded anything using C++, so I know that maybe the code is not as clean as it should, or some things could be coded in a better way, but I completed this game to the best of my ability. I had never before used C++, because while I studied my degree, all programming was done in Java, and in my later work experiences, I only used Python, but I definetly see the potential this language has and will set myself to master it in as much of a short time as possible in order to succes in the Master.
#
I also would like to express my gratitude for the oportunity and the challenge.
